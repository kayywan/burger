# burger
In this assignment, I'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM!

Status: W.I.P.

This app will allow a user to fill in a burger they are planning or wanting to eat.  When they have fulfilled their burger eating desire, they can press the "devour" button and it will move the burger they had entered into the "Devoured" section.
